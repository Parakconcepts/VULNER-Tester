# VULNER-Tester
Automated tool for Mapping LAN, checking for Common Vulnerabilities and Testing for Weak Password
I created this tool as a project submission for Think Cyber training, instructor was David Shiffman, in 2022

**Two scripts are used, the executable (./PT-Project.sh) and function script(PT-Functions.sh) imported into the executable script. The two files must be placed inside same folder to run **
